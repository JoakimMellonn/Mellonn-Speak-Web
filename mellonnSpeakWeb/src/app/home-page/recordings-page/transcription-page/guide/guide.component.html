            <p>Say what?! If it wasn't what was said in the recording, you can always change it!</p>
            <p>This is done easily by clicking the bubble and changing the text. When done, you can press enter or the save button.</p>

            <p>At any time you can give the participants labels, so you know who said what!</p>
            <p>Defining who's an interviewer or interviewee, changes who gets the green bubbles. You can use the play/shuffle buttons, to be sure who's who.</p>

            <p>Something happened that shouldn't happen, and you need to go back in time?</p>
            <p>Going back in time I can't help with, but going back in versions I can! Just go into the version history via the three dot menu, and the choose the version you wanna go back to! The top version is the default version (the one created by the AI), just under there is the newer versions, starting with the current one.</p>

            <p>When you're all done, you can export the transcription as a Word-document (DOCX).</p>
            <p>This is done in the three dot menu, and then "Download as DOCX".</p>
